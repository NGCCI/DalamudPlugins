# Dalamud Plugins
Contains the repository JSON file for my Dalamud Plugins for third party plugin support in api4 (for Dalamud v6.0.0.0+).

## How to use

**NOTE: Plugins in this repo are only for api4 / Dalamud v6.0.0.0+, if you're using the old Dalamud please check [this branch](https://github.com/Bluefissure/DalamudPlugins/tree/Bluefissure)**

* Access Dalamud's settings by typing `/xlsettings` in the chat window and pressing enter.
* Click on the "Experimental" tab.
* Copy and Paste in the following URL into one of the blank inputs under the "Custom Plugin Repositories" section: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bluefissure/DalamudPlugins/Bluefissure-api4/pluginmaster.json`
* If you cannot access Github, use this mirror `https://raw.fastgit.org/Bluefissure/DalamudPlugins/Bluefissure-api4/pluginmaster.json `
* Click the "+" button to add it to the list.
* Check the "Enabled" box for your new entry.
* Click "Save and Close" at the bottom.

From here, you can now install my plugins from within the game by typing `/xlplugins` in the chat and hitting enter.
Now, just select one of my plugins you wish to install like normal, and click "Install".
All of my plugins are tagged with my username "Bluefissure", so you can enter that in the search field to see all of the plugins I've created.

## Updating Plugins

When an update is available, you will be able to click the "Update plugins" button on the "Plugin Installer" accessed by typing `/xlplugins` in the chat and pressing enter.
